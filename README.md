# CPU 6502 Emulator
_COMING SOON_

This repository will hold source code for 6502 CPU emulator library (as well as example emulator alone)
once finished. Emulator libary, as well as emulator itself is going to be done in C, purely for practice
purposes in low level programming. Emulator is going to behave almost exactly like the real hardware,
including all of the memory handling, registers and arithmetic operations.
