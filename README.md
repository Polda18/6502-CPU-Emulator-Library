# 6502 CPU Emulator Library
_COMING SOON_

This repository will hold source code for 6502 CPU emulator library (as well as example emulator alone)
once finished. Emulator libary is going to be done in C, purely for practice purposes in low level
programming. Emulator is going to behave almost exactly like the real hardware, including all of
the memory handling, registers and arithmetic operations.
