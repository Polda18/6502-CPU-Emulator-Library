/********************************************************************
 * 6502 CPU Emulator Library
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This project is put together to offer dynamic link library
 * for various computer emulators utilizing a 6502 CPU emu layer.
 * 
 * This library is based on the real hardware, it offers functions
 * for cycles computation, for op codes resolvent, and contains
 * static definitions for the registers, flags and declarations
 * for memory assignment. For development purposes, a separate
 * download for header files is available for download, including
 * op codes definitions in "opcodes.h" file. Choose whichever
 * version you're going to go with (Windows or Unix: Linux/MacOS)
